							  Project Creators agree to make a good faith attempt to compensate each member by its Estimated Delivery Date.<br />
							  For all campaigns, Launcherr gives to the Project Creator each Backer’s User ID,  email address and a link to the users facebook profile. .<br />
							  Launcherr does not offer refunds. <br />
							  Launcherr reserves the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend a campaign at any time and for any reason. Launcherr is not liable for any damages as a result of any of those actions. Launcherr’s policy is not to comment on the reasons for any of those actions.<br />
